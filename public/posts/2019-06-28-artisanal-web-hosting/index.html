Summary
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I have an operations background. My first company taught me most of what I know about how to run software and server operations. Fast-forward 15 years and we are now all about the cloud, VPSs, and Kubernetes. I love <a href="https://arenzana.org/2019/04/blogging-with-org-mode/">the cloud</a>. Up until a few weeks ago, my blog has been hosted at <a href="http://scaleway.com/">Scaleway</a>, which has worked great for me. Today I run it on my own server where (for better or for worse) everything is managed by me.</p>

Why
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
One thing I was not happy about was Google Analytics. To keep my uptime I want to know the number of page loads and system load in order to optimize and scale. I know, I should probably be using a CDN to mitigate some of these issues, but I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m there just yet. Google Analytics is one of those services that is not known to be privacy friendly, and if you are here, I respect you and your time. I don&#39;t include ads and I try to keep the tracking as limited as possible disabling social crap, etc. For my purposes, I don&#39;t need Google analytics. A web server logs all of the information I need for scaling purposes. All I needed was to access those logs (which I already had access to) and store the data in a database, create a dashboard, and kiss Google Analytics goodbye.</p>
<p>
I know, I could&#39;ve used AWS or Google Cloud to do this; but the cost over time would have been prohibitive. Self-hosting seems like the right answer at the moment.</p>
<p>
The game plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>With the help of my company, I got a new server and some data center space (power, networking, and a rack). I know, this is the most tricky part as not everyone works for a telco that can provide these things. The point of this post is not to justify the financial advantage of self-hosting vs the cloud, but to point out the elements we overlook by leaving it up to the cloud to do some of the heavy lifting.</li>
<li>I installed ESXi on the server to run all my infrastructure. I have done this before, so I felt fairly comfortable reproducing this.</li>
<li>I used VyOS for all the networking and firewall needs. This was the trickiest part. I hate networking. I still do and the networking concepts, to be honest, just beat me. Somehow though, with basic subnetting and routing skills, you can actually get surprisingly far.</li>
<li>I used <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> to define all my (CentOS 7) infrastructure and <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> to automate/standarize the configuration of every element in my little cloud.</li>
<li>NGINX to host my site (quite straight forward).</li>
<li>Run an Elastic stack (really, just <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/beats">Beats</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a>, and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana">Kibana</a>) for data processing. From system auditing, to security, log parsing, and metrics. This stack is the central unit that gives me visibility into what&#39;s happening inside my system. This includes NGINX log analysis.</li>
</ol>

tl;dr
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Over the next few weeks I&#39;ll be writing about my experience <span style="text-decoration: underline;">moving away from the cloud</span>. The work it involved, where I believe it&#39;s better than the cloud, and where I believe the cloud is superior. I will talk about what&#39;s left in my set up and how I&#39;m planning on tackling it.</p>
<p>
They say the journey is as important as the destination itself and, in this case, I must agree. I have learned a lot through the process. Perhaps someone will learn something from my experience. That will make it all worth it!</p>
