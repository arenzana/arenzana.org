  Feeling like writing in English and, why not, raise my rating a little bit. Apparently the rates on my blog only go up whenever I write a post in English which, as you know, doesn&#8217;t happen very frequently.

  It&#8217;s Friday 10:59am and I can already feel myself going into weekend mode which, basically means that once I&#8217;m done with my daily basic tasks (work related of course) I start surfing around Youtube and installing beta releases of new linux distros just for the sake of testing the new KDE desktop (ie Fedora 9 at the moment). Crikey.

  Namaste.
