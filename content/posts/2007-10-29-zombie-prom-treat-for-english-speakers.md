For all those english-speaking readers (which I know I have a few); I&#8217;m writing this post in their mother language. This evening surfing through iTunes &#8216;freebies&#8217; I came accross [Zombie Prom][1]. I downloaded it and played on my brand new iPod. It was quite a funny as well as surrealist 34-minute short which got my attention from the beginning all the way through the end. I must recommend it for two reasons; first of all it&#8217;s free and second&#8230; it&#8217;s interesting.

Well, this is it so far. I promise I will write some more posts in English when my Spanish is not in the mood and/or upon request (what is usually called &#8216;English on-demand&#8217;).
