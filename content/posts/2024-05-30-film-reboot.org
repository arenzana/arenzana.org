After many years dormant, I have decided to restart my photography [[https://isma.photo][site]]. This time, however, it's not about the business of photography but to simply display some of my work in film.
I have always loved photography, I even did it professionally for a while. But there is nothing like the simple act of picking up a film camera, shoot, and pray that something good came out. Hope that the roll actually wound and didn't get exposed by accident... hey, at least I don't need to charge anything!
