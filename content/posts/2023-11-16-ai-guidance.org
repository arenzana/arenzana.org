Unless you've been living under a rock and regardless of your technical skills, you must've noticed how AI is now everywhere in our lives. Some even say that it will [[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/07/five-ways-ai-might-destroy-the-world-everyone-on-earth-could-fall-over-dead-in-the-same-second][take over our lives]].

Just like it happened a few years ago with blockchain, companies are now trying to include AI in every single aspect of software product development, regardless of whether it's needed or not.

There are, however, some great use cases for AI. It has, for example, given me great guidance in areas where I'm not very well-versed, such as automated GIS processing with ArcGIS Enterprise. Was it perfect? No it wasn't. But it gave me _good guidance_.

Another great use for AI is to make illustrations. I am no artist, but sometimes I want to illustrate a blog post or a Tweet without the need of a stock image. Maybe the image I'm looking for is too specific or obscure. While not perfect, it gets you /very/ close.

* Game Changer?
AI might take over the world, but it won't be over the next few years. While it gets us 90% of the way there, it's not 100% what a human can do, and it's that remaining 10% that will be the hardest.
