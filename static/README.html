      <div class="markdown">
          <h1 id="readme">README</h1>
<p>Hello! This is Isma and this is my README. If you're reading this,
you're probably reporting to me. You can think of this README as sort of
a first approach to my management style, what you can expect from me,
and what I expect from you.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>I have a mixed operations/software development/business
background, with formal education on the last two. I can easily talk all
day long about all three of them with little authority on
either.</p></li>
<li><p>I was born and raised in Spain and this fact may be reflected in
the way we interact: expect passionate (but respectful) work-related
discussions and polite smiles to American football remarks. As a good
European, expect me to wear scarves during the winter.</p></li>
<li><p>Spanish is my first language, English is not. I want to apologize
in advance for any misunderstandings. I am very aware of cultural and
linguistic differences and I'm intentional about making sure communication
is fluid and misunderstandings rare.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="work-philosophy-values-and-expectations">Work Philosophy,
Values, and Expectations</h2>
<p>Part of my work is to facilitate yours. This includes answering
questions, make resources available, and filtering out noise coming down
our way.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of our work, I value quality over quantity, and
that will hopefully be reflected in the workload I assign to you. That
being said, if you feel like the quality of your work is being
sacrificed by the load or deadlines assigned, I expect you to let me
know.</p>
<p>I expect excellency from you. That is not to say "perfect code" or
"perfectly monitored systems", but going the extra mile to do your best
work. If you're a developer, code should be tested. If you're an
operator troubleshooting an issue, a root cause is expected rather than
a simple restart. As a team, we want to take pride on the work we do for
public safety.</p>
<p>Every line of code we ship (or don't ship) has an impact of people's
safety. Unavailable or incorrect location could potentially be fatal to
someone's life. We need to treat every service and every release with
this thought in mind. If you have questions about the quality of a
release, element, product, you are expected to bring it to my attention
(even if it's my own doing).</p>
<p>You are always welcome to come to me with questions. Be ready to
explain the research you have done, approaches you have taken and
solutions you have tried to come to a solution by yourself. If all those
have failed, I'll give you guidance or work with you help you come to a
solution.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-how-to-give-and-how-i-give">Feedback (how to give and
how I give)</h2>
<p>All feedback is welcome. This is what you need to know about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am okay with positive feedback. Just don't overdo it.</p></li>
<li>I value negative feedback as I believe it's the only way to
improve as a person and professionally. Two requirements of negative
feedback:</p>
<ol>
<li> Direct but respectful and polite. Nobody reacts well to rude
feedback.</p></li>
<li> Make it as specific and measurable as possible. <i>"You're bad a bad
developer"</i> is not good feedback. Instead, try something like <i>"in places
like this and this your code could be less verbose and more efficient.
You may want to try this and this instead"</i>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I will do my best to put myself in your position and will understand
it comes from good intentions with the goal of building me up rather
than bringing me down.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Even though directness is not in my nature, I will strive to give you
the best feedback possible.</p>
<p>Disagreement is feedback and the sooner we learn how to efficiently
disagree with each other, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other
more. Ideas don’t get better with agreement.</p>
<h2 id="one-on-ones">One-on-Ones</h2>
<p>You can expect to meet with me on a one on one basis every two weeks.
To me, these are the most important meetings of the week and I hope you
can find value in them too.</p>
<p>These are not status update meetings. We have other meetings for
that. If you feel like you want to give me a status update on something
or have a quick project-related question for me, you can tell me at the
beginning of our meeting.</p>
<p>The goal of these meetings is to make sure we are on the same page,
for you to know where I think there can be improvements, and for you to
let me know where I may be falling short. Feel free to bring any
HR-related concerns/issues you may have. I may not be able to resolve
them for you, but I can either guide you or intercede on your behalf if
necessary.</p>
<h2 id="worklife-boundaries">Work/Life Boundaries</h2>
<p>I work a bit some weekends. This is my choice. I do not expect that
you are going to work on the weekend unless there is a public
safety-affecting issue or production work that cannot be scheduled any
other time. I might Slack you things, but they can always wait until
work begins for you on Monday. If something urgent comes up, I will text
you/call you.</p>
<p>Likewise, feel free to Slack me after hours. I may or may not respond
depending on availability and/or notification settings. If you have
something urgent to escalate or bring to my attention, you can reach me
at +1 (260) 797-6529.</p>
<p>I take vacations. You should, too. Disconnected from work is when I
do some of my best work. Not taking vacations, invariably leads to
burnout and can negatively affect the team.</p>
